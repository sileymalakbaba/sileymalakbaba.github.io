                        Deli Dilemma, an interactive 2D game which i created using IntelIj and coded with Java, it is my first time using Java
                        slightly frustrating, however i have managed to do the best i can to create a functioning game with 3 Levels, Collision handlers
                        Players, characters, sounds,random generators, and functions.

                    <p>
                        My game is based on an old school arcade game i used to play.
                        My game requires the players/player to eat all the food, without dying, eating a certain amount of food causes the score to increment
                        and if enough food is consumed we continue on to the next level.
                        The players/player has 3 lives throughout the game, to keep all our lives we must make sure we dont eat any of the dirty socks.
                        if we do lose our lives we respawn and restart again in level 1.
                        the aim of the game is to try not eat any dirty socks and progress to the next level, level 3 is the last level with a police officer
                        chasing us down outside of the deli, the food count must be completed in order to complete the game.
                        the generation of the food required a StepListener, and multiple collision handlers.
                        Each food item, and character has a distint sound, we know we have ate a dirty sock by the vulgar noise it creates
                        SO good luck! try your best to not eat any socks and survive the levels!
